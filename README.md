# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Link](https://notify-cowin.netlify.app/)

## Description

When you open the [link](https://notify-cowin.netlify.app/), a notification will popup asking you to give permissions to give notification. If you want notification, then click on “Allow”.

Search by selecting state and district and if there are vaccines available for age>18 and <45 it will show up. Also, the website will keep polling the data every 30 seconds so that you will get the notification as soon as vaccine becomes available. Also, make sure that you keep the website open in browser as it is a client side app and works on runtime.

As I just developed this in 1 day, there is a lot of scope for improvement as well. Please give you initial thoughts and give feedback before I share this in a wider forum.

The intention of the website is to inform the user as soon as the vaccine becomes available in the area. So I have kept everything very minimal and concise in the UI.
